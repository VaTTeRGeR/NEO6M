# NEO6M
Fast, easy and compact library for getting latitude/longitude/height and horizontal/vertical-accuracy from the neo6m with only 3 lines of code.

The minimal example project "SimpleGPS" shows you how to use the library.

It is important that you edit "neo6m.h" before you use the library to set which serial port is used!

To use SerialX set this (replace X with any number):
>#define _serial SerialX

Thats all!
